# Community Library - Rails with jQuery Front End

### A Rails application for tracking books in your library, and sharing/borrowing books from others!

## Usage

To use this app, fork and clone this repo, run bundle install, run `rake db:migrate` and then run locally with `rails s -p 3000` (can access rails console with `rails c`). Create a user account and add as many books as you'd like. You can track your own book collection with this app, and/or use in conjunction with friends. The app allows you to mark some books as 'available' which means other users can request to borrow them. And users are able to borrow books others have marked as 'available', and return when done.

To track books you've enjoyed, leave a comment when you borrow a book - these comments are always viewable from your homepage. These comments are visible to other users when the book is available for borrowing, and visible to the book's owner.
